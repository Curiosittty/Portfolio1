My first portfolio, design by me, code by AI.


It's the 3rd day. I'm reconsidering the site map. I think it would be better to have a single long page instead of two pages. The reason being that I think that this hurdle might break the attention of the user. Since I am indecisive about this, it'd be better to clone this project and edit that other one. So I can come back to it if I change my mind. It's 20-12-25. The site is deployed but no real information has been added.
